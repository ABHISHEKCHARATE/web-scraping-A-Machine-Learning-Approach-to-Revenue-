I performed web scraping to collect data on the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. from Wikipedia's Fortune 500 list. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I analyzed revenue growth and company performance. XGBoost outperformed other models, achieving an R-squared value of 0.74, providing valuable business insights.

I performed web scraping to collect data on the largest publicly traded companies
in the United States by revenue, sourced from Wikipedia s Fortune 500 list. After extracting the data,
I cleaned and preprocessed it by handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numeric formats,
and structuring the dataset for analysis. I then conducted data analysis to identify trends in revenue growth,
industry distribution, and company performance. I applied multiple machine learning models, including RandomForestRegressor and XGBoost,
 to predict revenue growth, tuning the models for optimal performance. The conclusion showed that XGBoost outperformed other models,
providing accurate predictions, with a notable R-squared value of 0.74, demonstrating the effectiveness of the machine learning approach for business insights**
